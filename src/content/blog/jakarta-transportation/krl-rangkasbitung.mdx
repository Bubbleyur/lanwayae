well, here we go. **Rangkasbitung** Line, this is my day-to-day line whenever i go to jakarta. why? because this is my one and only line that is close to my home. so yeah, i have no choice but to use this line. and honestly, this was the most busiest line i've ever used in jakarta's commuter line system. every hour, every minute, this line is always packed with people. especially during rush hours. there's no seat available, and you have to stand the whole trip. it's really tiring, especially if you have to stand for a long time.
