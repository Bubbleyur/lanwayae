## Overview

This is my personal website, built using an existing framework and UI system created by **hexaa**, then adapted and extended to fit my own needs and style.

Originally designed as a portfolio framework, it became a solid foundation for experimenting, structuring ideas, and turning abstract thoughts into something tangible. This project reflects how I learn, build, and execute ideas over time.

The website is continuously evolving, with ongoing improvements, refactors, and new features.

## Philosophy

I enjoy building things that feel complete — even when they start small.

Coding, for me, is not only about shipping products, but about organizing ideas, understanding systems, and connecting concepts to real-world execution. This website serves as a space to explore that process.

## Open Source & Credits

This website is open-source.

The framework and UI foundation are created by **hexaa**  
👉 https://github.com/hexaaagon

This project builds on top of that work, with modifications, additions, and personal adaptations for my own portfolio.

**Create your own. Build on top of it. Make it yours.**
